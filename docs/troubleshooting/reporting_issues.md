# Reporting Issues

When reporting an issue you are having, please include **as much detail as possible**. Some useful information that would be helpful would include:

*   Specific error messages
*   Server name(s) that are being used
*   Location of where you are connecting from (On-campus, VPN, etc.)
*   Clear screenshots that provide context
*   Steps to reproduce the problem
*   Attempted solutions/workarounds

Again, you do not need to provide all of this information, but having these details would be help us identify and resolve the issues you are having.

# Common Issues

## I get an error 'No space left on device' when trying to copy files to LSS

This means your LSS share is likely full. Please see [this guide](../usage.md) to check your usage or [this guide](../request_space.md) to purchase more space.

## I am off campus and am not able to connect to LSS

Please see the 'Mounting over VPN or from a personally owned device' section of [this guide](../mount_folders.md#mounting-over-vpn-or-from-a-personally-owned-device).

## I am receiving "Permission Denied" when trying to access LSS on novadtn

You need to issue the `kinit` command and enter your net-id password.  This will allow you to authenticate and access the share.

# Access Model

Your lab access group (eg `lss-research-<netid>-lab`) is created for you when you request your share. While the billing app only supports adding netids as members we can add ASW lists that you manage as well, just email us at lss-help@iastate.edu

The assumed permissions model for LSS is everyone in the access group has full access to the share and everything in it. This was a decision to reduce administrative load and keep support calls to a minimum when LSS was originally conceived. 

## Custom Permissions

While not officially supported by the LSS team it is possible to set custom permissions on the folders in your share. We do not recommend that you do this as it complicates access to your files and could result in files not being accessible by others in your group or files others upload into your share not being accessible by you.

Permissions to folders within your share can be manipulated through the normal folder permissions dialog, you will however have to disable inheritance in the 'advanced' permissions dialog to prevent the default permissions set from being applied to the folder in question. With inheritance disabled you should be able to set permissions as you'd like for the directory and any children you decide to create.

As this is not officially supported the amount of time the LSS team will be able to put in if you run into access issues will be minimal and may result in us applying a simpler ACL structure to resolve the issue.

Your lab access group will always function as the access restriction to your share, if someone is not in that group they will not be able to access your share or any file in it.


# Manage Access

User serviceable lists will be going through major changes in the near future. As such requests for adding or removing users or groups from a share access group are handled through email. Please reach out to lss-help@iastate.edu if you need to add or remove members.
